        <h1>Hey, I'm Jasper.</h1>
        <p>I'm a student exploring the world of tech and trying to figure out where I fit in. I don't have a deep background in programming or development yet, but I'm always interested in learning new thingsâ€”especially when it comes to creativity, problem-solving, and figuring out how stuff works.</p>
        <p>I'm currently studying computer science and slowly getting my hands dirty with different tools, projects, and ideas. Just trying to find my lane and build something cool along the way.</p>
        <p>Recently, I've been diving more into Python and web development. I'm not an expert, but I've been writing more code and learning through trial and error. It's been a solid way to grow my skills and get more confident with how things actually run behind the scenes. It's not always clean, but I like building stuff that works and figuring things out as I go.</p>
